## Description

This is an app where users can view and search for universities by a number of parameters. Sign in through Devise to write reviews for any university as well. Will_Paginate allows for easy viewing on the university page and selected API calls help to narrow down your search.

Users can access:
- All universities and their reviews via GET requests to the University API

Authenticated users can access:
- Generate POST requests to add reviews to universities

Queries:
- Filters universities by name
- Filters universities by description
- Filters universities by population
- Filters universities by mascot

The application structure is outlined below.  

Models:
